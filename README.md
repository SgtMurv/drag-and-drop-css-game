# drag-and-drop-css-game

A plain old basic website. My first real attempt after all my time spent on web development to make a simple game using plain old HTML, CSS and JS. The aim is to create some kind of game where the user has to drag a character through some kind of environment to complete some kind of objective...

... yeah it's a vague description I know. In all honesty I don't know what this project is going to be yet. But all I know is, that I'm thoroughly enjoying building it so far :D
